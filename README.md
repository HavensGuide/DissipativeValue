Information-geometric analysis of NYC real estate transactions (2015-2024) using Madelung Flow Regression.

**Paper:** [The Dissipative Structure of Value](The%20Dissipative%20Structure%20of%20Value%2C%20Kai%20Cobbs.pdf) (SSRN, in processing)

**Code:** `Information_Geometry_of_NYC_Sales.ipynb`

## Key Results
- 52-day optimal temporal bandwidth derived from Cramér-Rao bounds
- Exponential price certainty/velocity tradeoff (R²=0.81)
- 72% of dynamics are "housekeeping heat" maintaining structure
- Excess heat Granger-causes Case-Shiller Index at 1-month lag (p=0.001)

## Methods
- Continuous-time kernel density estimation with causal constraints
- Fokker-Planck inversion for drift/diffusion extraction
- Information-geometric measures (Fisher information, Wasserstein geodesics via housekeeping reconstruction)
- Thermodynamic decomposition (Oono-Paniconi framework)
